•	Chairs are the top-selling product, accounting for over 44% of total category sales.

•	California and New York are high-performing regions and critical for revenue generation.

## Recommendations
•	Analyze profit margins and operational costs across categories, especially chairs, to address the profit decline.

•	Enhance shipping efficiency: Consider optimizing logistics to shorten delivery times while maintaining cost balance.

•	Focus marketing efforts on top-performing states and cities (e.g., California, New York City).

•	Plan early for peak seasons, especially Q4, by aligning promotions and inventory for holiday demand.

•	Evaluate pricing strategies and discounting practices that may be affecting profitability.
